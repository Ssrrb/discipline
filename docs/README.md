# This is my first Excellent Project Back to Back
## Read and Refine this Idea Every single day, make it as clear and concise as possible

The idea is to have a WhatsApp-Based AI-Assistant Platform with a full-featured e-commerce webpage and a modern responsive UI so the clients can chat with the AI and interact with the database via Whatsapp, the solution is a B2B platform. Its main feature is that the employees can request to restock products via Whatsapp and in the webpage visualize dashboards, the store sales and the inventory, also the user can create a new store or branch. This wedge solution targets micro-merchants with a lightweight, WhatsApp-native commerce platform. The idea is to meet shopkeepers where they already operate – and in Latin America, that’s WhatsApp (used by over 92% of internet users in the region). The initial product could be as simple as a WhatsApp chatbot or mobile app that lets a store reorder inventory from distributors via chat or voice message and keep a digital log of transactions in the webpage that has an Admin dashboard and a webstore. For example, a bodega owner could send a voice note saying, “Need 20 crates of Coca-Cola by Friday,” and the system’s AI (integrated with WhatsApp’s API) would transcribe it, confirm the order with a supplier, and record the transaction in a dashboard.

## Principles
- Modular Design, Everything has a clear why and a how
- Comprehensive Testing: AI and CI will Automate Testing
- Robustness and Defensive Programming, Everything must be validated and secure
- Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
- Documentation and Code Quality: All written aspects will be excellent
- Agile is the way. We'll Deliver software in small, manageable increments to gather feedback and make adjustments.

## Pages
[✔] StoreName
[✔] Products
[✔] Orders
[✔] Analytics
[✔] Settings (includes API access)

1- StoreName name page should be the onboarding where users put their whatsapp number to interact with the Bot, it should also have a bot status indicator, and have a welcome message to the user, should also have an immediate action to support if bot is not working.
2- Products page should show allow the admins to add the products to their database and show the actual products in a grid.
3- Orders page is an integration to their e-commerce platform if they decide to make one, else it just should show the API access to create it.
4- Analytics page should show the three separated dashboards 📈 Sales | 📦 Inventory | 🤖 Bot and graphs relevant to each one.(probably bot integrate later)
5- Settings page should Manage store preferences, and database information
